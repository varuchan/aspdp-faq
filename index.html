Paraprofessionals may take these courses toward the NYS 75 hour Professional Development requirement.

			All NYC DOE teachers, secretaries, paraprofessionals, and NYC Charter School teachers may take “P” In-Service courses for “P” Credit. Paraprofessionals may only use “P” credits toward their NYS Professional Development hours. Guidance counselors may only take Guidance or Special Education courses for In-Service “P” credit. NYC private and parochial school teachers may take a “P” In-Service course to further their own knowledge and may be used towards the NYS 175 hours of Professional Development requirement but no credit will be issued.
